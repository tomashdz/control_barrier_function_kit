    "In this notebook, we consider a nonlinear control affine system. Due to the choice of barrier function and the nonlinearity of the system, we utlize higher-order barrier functions.\n",

    "1. An implementation of a higher order CBFs (HOCBF) for start-to-goal control on a nonlinear system.\n",
    "2. The formulation of the HOCBF as a quadratic program.\n",

    "The system state is the 2D positon and orientation, $\\begin{bmatrix} xr_0 & xr_1 & xr_2 \\end{bmatrix}^T = \\begin{bmatrix} x & y & \\theta \\end{bmatrix}^T$.\n",
    "Given an initial position $x^{init}$, our goal is to control this system to a goal location $x^{goal}$.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "However, the system should avoid certain areas in the workspace (more on this later).\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to solve this problem is to pose it as an optimization problem where we apply a safety constraint to an existing reference controller which prevents collision to obstacles. Specifically, we would like to solve the following problem:\n",

    "\\min_{u} \\quad ||u_{ref} - u|| \\\\\n",
    "\\textrm{s.t.} \\quad \\text{CBF constraints to be added later} \\tag{3}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "So, we will try to minimize the distance between the decission variable $u$ and reference controller $u_{ref}$, while satisfying some constraints. For now, let us disregard the constraint and focus on designing a reference controller.\n",

    "This is a two dimensional vector that takes the difference between the current system state (or location) and the goal location and multiply it with a gain factor $k$. This **simple** reference controller will take us from an initial location to the goal location. We can say it is a typical [proportional controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_control). Next, we need to make sure that the system does not enter undesired states.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Control Barrier Function (CBF) as Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that the undesired regions in the workspace can be defined with one or more [ellipses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse). Note that we could also use [hyperellipses](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Hyperellipse.html) which may be suitable for closely approximating rectangles while maintaining continuity properties. \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{z^2_0}{a^2} + \\frac{z^2_1}{b^2}\\leq 1 \\tag{5}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $z_0,z_1$ define the origin and $a,b$ define the major, minor axes of the ellipse, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we would like to check whether our system is in the undesired region and therefore the following would enable us to do so:\n",
    "$$\n",

    "Compared to tutorials 1 and 2, we consider a more general definition of CBFs since in this case our system is an affine control system (eq. (1)) whose dynamics are a function of both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$.\n",

    "- Deadlock may be caused due to symmetry in cases where a robot is going exactly at the center of the obstacle. This can be avoided by adding perturbations to the control input.\n",
    "- In practical applications, the CBF constraint may be relaxed with a slack variable to avoid issues with feasibility of the problem. In this case, however, you may loose the theoretical guarantess on safety.\n",
